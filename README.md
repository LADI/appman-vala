Appman
===============

Appman is a library (single-threaded) written in Vala to manage the applications installed on a Linux system. Infact, its name means Application Manager (Appman).
You could use this library to write your application launchers.
The library comes from Rocket-Launcher but I made some changes to make it better. Look at the [strcture] (https://github.com/echo-devim/RapidLauncher/blob/master/STRUCTURE.md).
